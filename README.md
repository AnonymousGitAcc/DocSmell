# Documentation Smell

## Intro
Documentation smells can be described as bad documentation styles that do not necessarily make a documentation incorrect but make it difficult to understand and use.


## Types
We present 5 types of documentation smells. They are:
* Bloated: too lengthy and verbose.
* Excess Structural Info: too many structural syntax or information
* Tangled: too complex to read and understand
* Fragmented: scattered over multiple pages or sections
* Lazy: does not provide extra info other than the method prototype


## Survey
We conducted a survey of 21 software developers to validate these documentation smells. The survey questionnaire is available at the 'Survey' folder. 


## Benchmark Dataset
We created a benchmark dataset of 1000 documentations with these 5 types of smells. The benchmark dataset is available at the 'Benchmark Dataset' folder.


## Automatic Detection of Documentation Smells
We employed rule-based, shallow, and deep machine learning techniques to automatically dectect these 5 types of smells.

## Codes
Codes of our rule-based, shallow, and deep learning classifiers are available at three different subfolders under 'Codes' folder. The codes are organised in a sequential manner. All file&folder names are self-explanatory.
